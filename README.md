# RAGE-Game
## Game Overview:
Scream into the mic to break the "items" (turn the lights off) in the room (circuit board). The "items" are represented with different lights (neopixels).
Blue will be the hardest to break with 109 dB, Red with 87 dB, Green with 60 dB, Yellow with 75 dB. Once all "items" have been broken
it will take you to the next stage while playing foreboding music.

In the next stage you are tired after yelling so much, so you do a simple smashing "items" exercise to catch your breath. You have LEDs 1 and 8 flashing a
random pattern. In the first sub stage the LEDs are green, you press the buttons to match the flashing sequence to move on to the next substage. There are 3 sub stages - Green, Red, Blue, as you progress the lights flash faster and the patterns are longer. If you pass all three sub stages then a triumphant sound plays aloud.

## Basic Rules:
Scream into the mic to shatter the varying glass "items". Once all items are broken push A and B buttons to match LEDs flashing lights pattern. 
If successful triumphant music plays, if not Womp Womp.
