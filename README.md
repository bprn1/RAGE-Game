# RAGE-Game
## Game Overview:
In the game you are smashing "items" to release some deep tension in yourself from all your finals. You have LEDs 1 and 8 flashing a random pattern. In the first sub stage the LEDs flash at a slow rate and you have
five seconds to press the button before you lose the game. Each time you correctly match the button press to the light lit up, you get one point. You move on from the Practice stage once you have scored 5 points, 
then the time you have to press the correct button shortens and the lights flash faster. There are a total of five stages, once you have reached a score of 40 you have won the game and can now play till you lose aka "Infinity Mode" or intentionally press the wrong button to restart the game. Also don't forget that if you ever want to pause the game just flick the switch and the game will pause! I hope you enjoy this game about smashing buttons and being swift with your thumbs to out time the game!

## Basic Rules:
Press buttons to turn off respective lights. When left button pressed, the left light turns off and timer restarts. When right button pressed, the right light turns off and timer restarts. If button and light don't match then you lose.
As you progress through the stages you gain points! Each time you pass a stage a voice will tell you "Moving Up!" and all the lights will turn green.
If you need to pause just flick the switch to pause.
If you reach 40 points triumphant music plays and a voice tells you "Great Breaking!", if not womp womp, you have lost and a voice will tell you "Moving Down..." and all lights will turn red, game will restart shortly afterwards.

## Inputs and Outputs
There are three main inputs there is the left button, right button, and switch button.
The outputs are tone, lights, and speaker library.

The left and right buttons turn off their respective left and right lights. Though if the wrong button is pressed the game restarts afterwards. The switch pauses the game, and resumes the game from where the player left off. The tone plays when the player moves up or down a stage, along with the speaker either congratulating or resentfully breaking the news to the player. 
The lights are shown in four ways:
1. The lights flash in a random pattern, and the player needs to match the random light displayed.
2. The lights flash green all around counter clock wise to show that the player is moving up to the next level.
3. The lights flash red all around clock wise to show that the player is moving down all the levels and restarting.
4. The lights finally flash random colors counter clock wise to show that the player has won the game and is now starting Infinity Mode, where the player can keep playing forever without the game getting harder.
